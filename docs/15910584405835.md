# Knowledge gained from experience is much more practical

Today, people rely a lot on gaining knowledge from books. However, it has been said that "Not everything is contained in books." Knowledge gained from book can be outdated, incorrect or even not clear. On the contract, from experience, we can also gain experience, which will be up to date, 


More practical:
- books may be outdated, experience can change
- knowledge experience will be easier to remember than from books.
- much clear than books
